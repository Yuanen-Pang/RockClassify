### Further explanation:
Due to the large storage space required for image data, it is inconvenient to upload with the code. However, it is easy for readers to download it themselves as it is publicly available at http://www.nimrf.net.cn/yk/tindex?category=3.  

In the "BoxImg" folder(create by yourself in this catalog), there are subdirectories where the first-level directories "0", "1", and "2" correspond to "Metamorphic Rocks", "Sedimentary Rocks", and "Igneous Rocks", respectively.
- In the "0" directory, the subdirectories "0", "1", "2", "3", "4" correspond to "Impact Metamorphic Rocks", "Dynamic Metamorphic Rocks", "Contact Metamorphic Rocks", "Regional Metamorphic Rocks", and "Thermal Contact Metamorphic Rocks", respectively.
- In the "1" directory, the subdirectories "0", "1", "2" respectively correspond to "Chemical Sedimentary Rocks", "Biogenic Rocks", and "Clastic Sedimentary Rocks".
- In the "2" directory, the subdirectories "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6" respectively correspond to "Ultramafic and Ultramafic Rocks", "Volcaniclastic Rocks", "Basic Rocks", "Acidic Rocks", "Veins", "Meteorites", and "Neutral Rocks".
